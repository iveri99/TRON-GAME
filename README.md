# TRON GAME PYTHON
Making a 2D tron game in python, using pygame
The plan is to initally have player 1 and player 2, that are controlled using arrow keys and wasd keys respectively
Then I will allow the user to make the choice of whether they want player 2 to become an AI computer instead

* First big obstacle was handling user inputs correctly, as the sprites weren't able to be controlled by keys
